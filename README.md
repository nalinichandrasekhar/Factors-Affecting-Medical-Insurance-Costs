Title
Factors Affecting Medical Insurance Costs

Overview
Healthcare costs vary across the United States for different individuals due to a combination of demographic and behavioral factors.
This project aims to visually explore patterns in the distribution of medical insurance charges and examine how individual characteristics
are associated with variations in cost. The analysis supports a better understanding of risk patterns and pricing considerations
through data visualization techniques.
